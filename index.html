    Swimming is the activity of moving the body through water using combined arm and leg motions for propulsion and natural flotation. It is a versatile activity,
        enjoyed both as a low-impact exercise that offers numerous physical and mental health benefits,
        and as a competitive sport with various strokes (freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly) featured in events from local meets to the Olympics.
        This essential life skill provides an all-around body workout that builds endurance, muscle strength,
        and cardiovascular fitness while reducing stress on the joints
        , making it accessible and beneficial for people of all ages and fitness levels.<br>
        <h1> golf</h1><br>
        Golf is a precision club-and-ball sport where players use various clubs to hit balls into a series of holes on a course using the fewest possible strokes.
        Unlike most ball games, golf does not use a standardized playing area,
        and each course has a unique design with varying terrain challenges like sand traps (bunkers),
        water hazards, and different lengths of grass (fairway, rough, green).
        The game can be played by any number of people, often as an individual pursuit against the course par (the target number of strokes for each hole) 
        or in a competitive format against other players,
        offering a combination of physical skill, mental strategy, and a social outdoor experience.
